Throughout my life, I have always been fascinated by energy and its potential for both creation and destruction. I am Galen Erso, a man caught between two worlds, and my story is not one of glory or triumph, but of love, sacrifice, and the pursuit of knowledge.

Born and raised on the idyllic world of Grange, I was fortunate to receive a proper education in physics and engineering. My inherent fascination with the very fabric of the universe drove me to the prestigious Futures Program on Coruscant. There, I devoted myself to studying kyber crystals, rare and powerful crystals with a peculiar energy output that could revolutionize energy production and supply for countless systems.

During these years of relentless study, I met the love of my life, Lyra. She was a woman of radiant spirit and shared my enthusiasm for the cosmos. Together, we welcomed our most precious creation, our daughter Jyn. She was our stardust, born from the love that spanned galaxies. She was a light, shining brighter than any kyber crystal in my lab.

Life was blissful, until the day that Orson Krennic walked into my life. A representative of the Empire, he approached me with an offer of resources to continue my work, resources beyond my wildest dreams. Naively, I accepted his offer, blinded by the prospect of making a difference in the galaxy.

I was so caught up in the potential of my research that I overlooked the dire implications it carried. The Empire wanted to use my work, my kyber crystal research, for a project of unimaginable scale. The moment I realized their intention, a cold dread washed over me. I was an architect of energy, not a fabricator of war. I made the decision to flee, to protect my family, and to keep my knowledge from falling into the wrong hands.

I became a farmer on the remote world of Lah'mu, living a quiet existence far away from the machinations of the Empire. Every morning, I would wake up to the same view, our little home against the green landscape, and every morning I would look at my stardust, my Jyn, and knew that this peaceful life was what we had to maintain.

However, the past always has a way of catching up. Krennic found us. He took me away, leaving my stardust alone in the world. I was forced to work on their project, the one I had been running from. As I labored, I always kept in mind the memory of my stardust, hoping against hope that one day I would see her again, in a galaxy free of the Empireâ€™s tyranny.

Even though I was an unwilling participant in the construction of their colossal project, I managed to embed a weakness, a beacon of hope, for anyone brave enough to exploit it. This was my redemption, my contribution to a brighter future.

The conclusion of my tale is steeped in tragedy, yet it remains an essential part of who I am. I am Galen Erso, a man of science and a loving father. I never wished for my work to cause harm, only to help build a better future for my stardust and all the others like her, scattered throughout the stars.
